# TB-TBG

By Sooah Kim

Player uses the mouse to select a level and their moves.
Player can use one move per turn by left clicking on one of the available moves on the bottom right of the combat scene and then selecting an opponent with the left click.
Player can also choose to skip/end turn by pressing on the End Turn button at the bottom right of the combat scene.

*There is currently a bug that makes it so that the end scene won't load. I could not find the solution to it.
